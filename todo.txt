- Add a button to download and upload current config
- somehow make a feature so that the plugin can read from the current page.
IF there are audio files there, consider it a "Web feed". IF it is an RSS page or the page 
contains the link to an RSS, use that RSS. 
- When loading an RSS feed, create an indicator that the RSS is loading 
- Make it possible to manually enter a "Web feed"
- sort the feeds
- split CSS to a separate file
- makr played, then the episode turns gray and the next in time is listed, yes, this can then exceed the max number per pod.
Right now, I would like to continue the RSS approach, but we may add some other mechanism in the future. The next feature I would like is a way to download and upload the current config. Essentially a list of Feeds. The config format should be prepared to add more information, for example which episodes has been played.
- store current postion in  audio file
- access to RSS catalog
