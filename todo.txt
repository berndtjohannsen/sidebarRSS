- separate different feeds in the player. Header line followed by audio files for that feed.
- With each feed header line, add "remove" and "refresh" button and an input telling
how many audio files that should be listed. Default is 3.
- in the audi lines, if present, add publish date for each audio files
- Fix the audio icon bug
- Add a button to download and upload current config
- somehow make a feature so that the plugin can read from the current page.
IF there are audio files there, consider it a "Web feed". IF it is an RSS page or the page 
contains the link to an RSS, use that RSS. 
- When loading an RSS feed, create an indicator that the RSS is loading 
- Make it possible to manually enter a "Web feed"
- prevent double loading of RSS feeds
